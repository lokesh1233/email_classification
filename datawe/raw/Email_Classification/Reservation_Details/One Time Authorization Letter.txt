Dear Sir/Madam,
 
Greetings of the day!
 
As per your request, I am sending you the one time authorization form for the reservation 75691SB029795.
 
Kindly fill in the necessary details and send it to the following e-mail ID's along with the front and back scan copy of the Credit Card. 
 
reservations@tajhotels.com

Since we only need an imprint of the credit card (front and back copy). You may feel free to mask the CVV number before sending us the scanned copy.
 
Should your company wish to claim Input Tax Credit on our invoices, please ensure that the relevant GSTIN number along with the appropriate address are communicated to us at the time of booking. It is important to note that the procedure set by the GST Network requires us to upload invoice with GSTIN numbers prior to check out. We may not be able to amend invoices after check out.
 
Please do not hesitate to contact us if we may be of further assistance to you.
         
Warm Regards,
Mahesh
