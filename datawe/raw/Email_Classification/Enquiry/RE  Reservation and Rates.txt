Dear Team 

My Family and Friends are planning to visit Chennai between 01-Jan-19 and 03-Jan-19 and they are looking to stay at Taj Fisherman's Cove (2 rooms, 1 room with 2 twin beds and 1 master bed), I was talking to the Taj reservation agent to check on the availability, I was told that there is availability. I was checking on the rates for TCS employees and I was given this id to check with. Could you please let me know do we have TCS rates for these dates and also I wouldn't be there on this occasion as I live in US, and it is only for family and friends, can I still avail the discounts, if so how. 

Please let me know. Thanks in advance. 

Best Regards,
