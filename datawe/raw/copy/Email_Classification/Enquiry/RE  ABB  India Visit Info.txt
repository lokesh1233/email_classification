Hi,
 
Your hotel was recommended to me by the local ABB office in Bangalore.
I want to check room availability for Monday 26 November to Thursday 29 November, for 1 person.
I’m also after an Airport Limousine transfer from Bengaluru Airport.
 
I’m available on +61 428 856 843 if you want to call me.
 
Looking forward to hearing back from you
