Subject: Sri Lankan Holiday - 16th Jan to 20th Jan 2020
 
Hi There,
We will be visiting Sri Lanka for a wedding and would like to stay at your hotel. We are a family of 4, my wife, 2 children (17 & 15) and myself. The preference is to stay in the one large room. We wish to stay there from the 16th of January to the 20th of January 2020. In this regard, I would appreciate if you will provide me with some options, as I wish plan my holiday around this event. Looking forward to a favourable and quick response. Thanks & regards. Rohan 
Kind regards
