Hi,
I am in the process of booking my holiday with the family and below are the details. Can you please confirm both the availability (at the properties you have in Goa), the best rates with dates and the room types with inclusions that you will be able to offer? Since it a larger group and you do not have the Villa pricing/availability on your website, I decided that this is probably the best way for you to provide the information.
Location: Goa, India
Probable Dates: Anytime between 20th December and 5th of Jan
Number of Nights: Minimum 3, Maximum 4
Rooms Required: 3 rooms / A villa with 3 rooms
Number of Guests: 5 Adults, 1 Child (2 couples, 1 single occupant with child)
Room Requirements: Includes Breakfast, Wi-Fi and Airport Transfers
Resort Requirements: Beach property, exclusive resort beach preferred, adult and children swimming pool
My preference is to have a Villa with 3 rooms, in case you do not have one with 3 rooms and have one with only 2 please provide the most ideal combination.
When you send me the details please send me the following information:
1. Dates quoted/availability for
2. Types of rooms/villa/size of the villa
3. Inclusions/exclusions
4. If the above mentioned room requirements are met
5. if the above mentioned Resort Requirements are met
6. Prices inclusive of taxes / per day / per room / per villa
7. What other offers you are providing … example … discounts at the bar / activities / local transport / spa vouchers etc.
Please do not hesitate to let me know if you have questions, but I believe the above should take care of most of the required information.
Look forward to hearing from you soon, so that I am able to close on your property and book the tickets accordingly.
Thanks,
Medha
