Dear Taj Bangalore,

I have a reservation with you (details below).  Is it possible for me
to pay for the room in advance i.e. before I travel?
I would like to dine at the hotel when I visit, what cards do you
accept for payment? Do you accept travel money cards like  the 'Qantas
Cash Card' which is where I can load foreign currencies onto it such as
the Indian rupee?
